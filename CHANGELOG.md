## [v0.5.0] - 2020-12-01

### Bye bye Postgres; Hello Dynamo

I'm done using TypeORM and Postgres.

### Added

- `process.env.TABLE_NAME`
  - this needs to be added in Vercel
- graphql-codegen
- update `updateUsername` to Dynamo logic

## [v0.4.0] - 2020-11-26

### BREAKING CHANGES

This change completely reworks the project structure, to avoid single gigantic GraphQL schemas/typedefs.

- previously: Things were divided by Query & Mutation
- new: Things are separated into "/modules" which more or less represent db entities or a certain domain, like AWS S3

This was a huge pain to figure out. One strange "duplicate Query.someField" error (that I did not see on another apollo-server project) was resolved by removing node_modules, and reinstalling.

I also deleted a ton of old resolvers, and removed PgTyped. As cool as it was to learn an write raw SQL queries for a bit... ain't nobody got time for that.

### Changed

- entire project structure to user 'modules' structure

### Removed
