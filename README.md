## Prerequisites

### `ormconfig.(yml|json|js)`

You will need an `ormconfig` file in the root directory (next to `package.json`) in order to call TypeORM's `createConnection()` with no configuration passed.

- `.yml` is the nicest option since it allows inline comments, and you don't need to worry about module exports

###### example `ormconfig.yml`

```yml
default:
  type: "postgres"
  host: "<rds-database-endpoint>" # update this
  port: 0000 # update this
  username: "<rds-database-username>" # update this
  password: "<rds-database-password>" # update this
  database: "postgres"
  # --- synchronize ---
  # Indicates if database schema should be auto created
  # on every application launch. Be careful with this option
  # and don't use this in production - otherwise you can
  # lose production data. This option is useful during debug
  # and development. As an alternative to it, you can use
  # CLI and run schema:sync command. Note that for MongoDB
  # database it does not create schema, because MongoDB is
  # schemaless. Instead, it syncs just by creating indices.
  synchronize: true
  logging: false
  entities: ["src/entity/**/*.ts"]
  migrations: ["src/migration/**/*.ts"]
  subscribers: ["src/subscriber/**/*.ts"]
  cli:
    entitiesDir: "src/entity"
    migrationsDir: "src/migration"
    subscribersDir: "src/subscriber"
```

# Migrations

## Generating Migrations

```bash
typeorm migration:generate -n ExampleMigrationName
```

This will generate a new migration called `{TIMESTAMP}-ExampleMigrationName.ts` with empty `up` & `down` migrations.

## Running and Reverting Migrations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

Make sure your `ormconfig.yml` has the correct values.

- `ts` code that runs the actual server, might read from `process.env.<ENV_VARIABLES>`,
- the TypeORM CLI will read from `ormconfig.(yml|json|etc)`

  - make sure they're both pointing to the correct databases... You might be unknowingly running migrations on the actual RDS instance ü§£...

- For more info, see the [TypeORM docs](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/migrations.md#running-and-reverting-migrations)

With `ts-node`:

```bash
# run
ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:run

# revert
ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:revert
```
